Resume for Full Stack Developer
Last month, I reviewed 100+ resumes and distilled some key tips to make your tech resume stand out in the competitive field.

1. Quick Scan Technique:
Take 10 seconds to scan your resume from the beginning.
Focus on the first half-page, reading the first 5 words of each sentence or bullet point.
Ensure your resume is packed with developer-oriented language like "Developed a REST API" or "Built a full-stack web app."
2. Tell a Story:
Your resume should flow like a story, avoiding a laundry list of technical jargon.
Use a format like [ACCOMPLISHMENT, IMPACT, CHALLENGE] to explain achievements.
Example: "Developed a server-side layout engine in iOS, teaching myself GoLang to automate 1000+ manual layouts. Worked with a coworker to drive the project to completion, launching company-wide."
3. Pitfalls to Avoid:
Skip non-engineering words like "Documented" or "Supported." Focus on development skills.
Keep low-priority information (hobbies, irrelevant skills) towards the bottom.
Don't spend too much time explaining the company or team; highlight personal contributions.
4. Last Impressions Count:
Your resume has a last impression too.
Avoid ending with forgettable details.
Consider adding a touch of personality by sharing a cool hobby or project.
Make yourself memorable as someone people want to meet.
